ðŸ“˜ Project Introduction
Project Title: Designing and Managing a Database for the Process Related to Saving Service on the Vietcombank Application

This project aims to design and manage a database system that supports the online savings service offered by Vietcombank (VCB) via its Digibank application. As digital banking becomes more prevalent, optimizing the database structure and process management is essential to ensure seamless user experience, accuracy in transaction handling, and robust data security.

Our database system was designed to:

Represent all the main entities and relationships involved in the savings process.

Facilitate efficient transaction handling and historical tracking.

Allow future extensibility for other banking services.

The project covers from business model understanding to logical and physical database design, and SQL queries to support real-world scenarios.
